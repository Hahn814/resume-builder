# Software Engineering Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
  - Favor simplicity in design and implementation; avoid unnecessary complexity.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
  - Eliminate duplication by reusing code and logic.

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**
  - Only implement features when they are actually needed.

- **SOLID Principles:**
  - **S**ingle Responsibility: Each module/class should have one responsibility.
  - **O**pen/Closed: Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification.
  - **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
  - **I**nterface Segregation: Prefer several specific interfaces over a single general-purpose one.
  - **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Divide code into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern.

- **Principle of Least Astonishment:**
  - Code should behave in a way that least surprises users and developers.

- **Fail Fast:**
  - Detect errors early and stop execution to avoid
